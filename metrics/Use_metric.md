USE METRIC
by Bryan Prichard

Open source software has a lot of need and equally as much use in the computer science industry. Thus it is important
to quantify those values and find how much people will use this software and to what ends. This will allow us to

1) Measure where the software is used and not used
2) use these values to find places to improve and where the software is working well
3) implement changes to increase use by improving the software.

There are obviously more values that are involved with use (i.e people actually knowing about the software and the changes we made)
so this is not a perfect solution but it will allow us another way to look at the software and trying to make it the
best we can.
